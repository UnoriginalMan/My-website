    <p>I will make another digital jounral when i dont want to go and make 1200 pages. That would be... awful XD</p>
    <p>So yeah, ill leave a link to that soon, anyways wait for this to be updated. I might even make an actual website
    like Newgrounds or a In-Browser game! Look at me go!</p>
    <p>Quick update: 𝗼𝗸 𝗶 𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗱𝗮 𝗳𝗶𝘅𝗲𝗱 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗯𝗹𝗲𝗺 𝗯𝘂𝘁 𝗶 𝗴𝘂𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗶𝗺 𝗴𝗼𝗻𝗻𝗮 𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝗱𝗼 𝘀𝗼𝗺𝗲𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗲𝗹𝘀𝗲.
    I might aswell stay for Times New Roman because the bold is kinda off.. just a little? you know? Updating soon.</p>
    <p>Updating Again, i might aswell use the Bold for titles. Updating soon, again.</p>

    on discord, open june 10th. (remember, TommyInnit#4664 (no questions asked). Update
    over.</p>
    <p>Update: I am running out of ideas to animate and i made a short
    and simple script for madness combat to upload on my channel. Heres
    the link v</p>
    <p>file:///media/fuse/drivefs-01fbd165aae3323beaa2e094360efae6/root/madnesscombatscript.html</p>
    <p>Please note: The script is a work in progress as so is the animation process, I will complete it in a week after on my birthday to cool off, so have fun watching that 5 minute video uploaded on my birthday june 17th!(or 10 minute video</p>
    <p>I made another website from my other computer! This is reffered to me and has all rights reserved. Update over!</p>
    <p>I made my own movie! I am still working on it, so i will upload it on June 20th. Hope you enjoy it in the future!</p>
    <p>Mostly i want to actually upgrade this website as much as i can with starting with the rookie numbers, but i am not a freaking MILLIONARE, so you will have to stay with this appearence until i upgrade with my skill with HTML code.</p>
    <p>10 days till the 10th of June. Expect that movie coming twice the date without the year or month not changing a single bit. Seriously though, i cant wait</p>
    <p>Im back. 6 more days. I feel sad for our teacher. I really want to show this to my school right now but cant since i need to make some changes and actually get them to download the file and then go to the website. I feel bad. I wish my teacher could see this right now. Update over.</p>
    <p>2 days. I am scarred for LIFE. What if they find out about this and what ive done? What if they see the data im doing? Im scared, and frightened. Update over.</p>
	<p>Good news! Im back, and im not giving up on this website. Including: I can keep the chromebook and the headset! (since my brother broke it which i deserve because i was watching youtube and lying.
	Any ideas for anything on this website? EMAIL! unoriginaliscommon@gmail.com</p>
	<p>Update over!</p>
	<p>So uh...... I have no ideas. Writers block.</p>
	<p>Update Over.</p>
